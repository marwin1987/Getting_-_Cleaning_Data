# Getting_-_Cleaning_Data
Course Project assignment

In this repo you will find an R script, named run_analysis.R. The script is made to make a very large dataset into a more structured, smaller and cleaner dataset. 
In the R script each step is described by a comment, so that viewing the code is not only easier to understand, 
but also more structured. 
In short, the R script does the following things:

1) it downloads the data into the working directory
2) every package that might be required is activated
3) the data is unzipped and has been read in to the memory
4) different datasets are combined and merged into one file
5) a selection is made for the meand and standard variation 
6) a new dataset is created with only the selected variables
